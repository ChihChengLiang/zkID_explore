You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: peer roommate or carpool matching
The verifier needs to establish: is not on a violent-offender list, shown to a stranger not an institution
Kind of claim (predicate type): non-membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: consented for benefit: the person hands it over voluntarily to receive a benefit or service (discount, subsidy, access)
The fact originates in: justice_security; it is used in: family_social
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-a-chaum-blind
  situation: A signer must certify that a holder has a valid token without seeing the token's content, and must later be unable to link the certified token back to the signing event.
  original setting: A ballot authority must sign a voter's ballot to certify it, but it must not learn how the voter voted, and the counted ballot must still be accepted as valid.
  mechanism: A blind signature, where the message is blinded with a random factor before signing, and the holder unblinds the signature so it verifies against the original message under the signer's public key. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting."
- id: an-a-tor-onion
  situation: A route must be relayed through intermediaries so that no single intermediary holds both the origin identity and the final destination, while the traffic still reaches the endpoint.
  original setting: A user's network path reveals both who they are and which destination they contact, because the first hop that sees their address also sees their traffic in full.
  mechanism: Onion routing, where the message is wrapped in one encryption layer per relay, and each relay peels only its own layer and passes the rest to the next hop. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Each intermediary generally knows only the immediately preceding and following nodes, limiting what any single relay can learn about the route."
- id: tw-gov-household-register-proxy-copy-discretion
  situation: A government office that holds a record may ask a proxy's requester for a copy of the principal's identity document, and the scope of what it may collect is left to the office's discretion.
  original setting: 內政部函釋：戶政事務所受理委託申請戶籍謄本時，得為蒐集委託人身分證明文件影本，並可斟酌裁量所需附繳證明。
  mechanism: None stated; collection of document copies left to agency discretion under PDPA and administrative procedure rules. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "即得為蒐集、處理申請人之個人資料（例如繳 驗委託人身分證明文件影本）"
- id: gdpr-data-minimisation
  situation: A rule obliges anyone requesting information to take only what the purpose needs, but gives no practical way to request less than a whole document.
  original setting: Controllers collect whole documents when a narrower field would serve the purpose.
  mechanism: Legal principle of data minimisation; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed"
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: tw-bank-deposit-dual-id-check
  situation: A bank must verify who a person is before opening an account, which means examining identity documents, but the cited rule does not say whether copies are kept or for how long.
  original setting: 金管會函釋：金融機構受理開立存款帳戶，應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分之措施，以防制金融犯罪。
  mechanism: Dual identity-document inspection at account opening; retention and copy handling not specified in the cited text. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/roommate-peer__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
