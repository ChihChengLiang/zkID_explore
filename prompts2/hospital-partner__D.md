You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: hospital ward allowing visits or consenting to treatment
The verifier needs to establish: is the patient's spouse, partner or named proxy
Kind of claim (predicate type): membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: safety security: collected to protect people or premises (access control, child safety, fraud/abuse prevention)
The fact originates in: family_social; it is used in: healthcare
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-a-chaum-blind
  situation: A signer must certify that a holder has a valid token without seeing the token's content, and must later be unable to link the certified token back to the signing event.
  original setting: A ballot authority must sign a voter's ballot to certify it, but it must not learn how the voter voted, and the counted ballot must still be accepted as valid.
  mechanism: A blind signature, where the message is blinded with a random factor before signing, and the holder unblinds the signature so it verifies against the original message under the signer's public key. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting."
- id: tw-securities-foreign-agent-id-copy
  situation: A foreign investor must prove that its local agent is a real, identified person, and the agent hands over a full copy of an ID card, with no alternative verification stated.
  original setting: 境外華僑及外國人經國內代理人辦理證券開戶時，代理人須檢附國民身分證或居留證影本。
  mechanism: None stated; full ID copy required with no less-intrusive alternative given. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "國內代理人或代表人之國民身分證、居留證影本或公司登記後之證明文件影本"
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: an-b-va-id-scanning
  situation: A venue must confirm that a person is over a threshold age from an identity document, but scanning captures the whole card, so the rule caps what is kept to a few fields and bans secondary use, while the holder still sees everything on the card at the moment of the scan.
  original setting: A merchant may scan the machine-readable zone of a driver's license for an age check, but the scan data it may collect and keep is limited to name, address, date of birth and license number, and may not be disseminated for marketing.
  mechanism: Statutory field-limit and retention ban on scan data, with a prohibition on sale or marketing dissemination; no proof-of-age mechanism that avoids reading the document. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Information collected by scanning an individual's driver's license or other document pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the individual's name, address, and date of birth and the number of the driver's license or other document;"
- id: rd-cnpd-lu-tourist-inspect-not-copy
  situation: A host must confirm a visitor's identity and eligibility, but the usual practice is to keep a copy of the whole identity document; the regulator says looking at it is enough.
  original setting: Tourist accommodation operators in Luxembourg ask to see guests' identity documents and some make copies; the regulator reminds them that inspection is allowed and copying is not.
  mechanism: Visual inspection of the identity document with no copy taken; the statutory duty is met by checking, not retaining. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "they may inspect their customers’ identity documents but must not under any circumstances make a copy of them"
- id: an-a-privacy-pass
  situation: A verifier only needs to learn that the holder passed an earlier check, but the proof it receives can be matched to the issuance event and to every other use of the same proof.
  original setting: Servers authorise clients with cookies that record a prior challenge, and the same cookie lets them track one client across sessions.
  mechanism: Clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to a prior authorisation, so the origin cannot link redemption to issuance or to other redemptions. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "the privacy goals of Privacy Pass are oriented around unlinkability based on redemption, issuance, and attestation contexts"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/hospital-partner__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
