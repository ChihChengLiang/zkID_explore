You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: stalker or scammer compiling public registers
The verifier needs to establish: is a company director or landowner, where combining public registers reveals a home address
Kind of claim (predicate type): cross-source-match
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: public record: the fact is already in a public register or published list
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: justice_security
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-telco-sim-live-photo-retention
  situation: A provider must confirm a new subscriber's identity before activating a service; the rule requires capturing a live photo of the person at point of sale, with no stated limit on retention.
  original setting: 依NCC指引，初次申辦行動門號者必須即時拍照留存，不願配合者門市應拒絕辦理。
  mechanism: None minimal; in-store photo capture required, no retention limit or less-intrusive alternative stated. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "要求初次申辦行動通信門號者必須即時拍照留存"
- id: tw-pdpa-art5-purpose-limit
  situation: A rule requires anyone collecting personal data to stay within the necessary scope of its stated purpose, but it gives no concrete way to show what was necessary, so the collector decides what counts as necessary.
  original setting: 個資法第5條要求蒐集、處理或利用個人資料不得逾越特定目的之必要範圍，並應與蒐集目的具正當合理之關聯。
  mechanism: Legal purpose-limitation and proportionality principle; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料之蒐集、處理或利用，應尊重當事人之權益，依誠實及信用方法為之，不得逾越特定目的之必要範圍，並應與蒐集之目的具有正當合理之關聯。"
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."
- id: rd-swiss-eid-necessary-data-only
  situation: A business needs one attribute to proceed, but the credential is issued as a whole, so the holder must rely on the wallet to release only the needed attribute.
  original setting: The Swiss e-ID is described as sharing only the data a transaction needs; the technical overview says selective disclosure and batch issuance enable this.
  mechanism: SD-JWT VC selective disclosure with OpenID4VP presentation and status-list validity check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The Swiss e-ID introduces a new approach to digital identity: only the necessary data is shared."
- id: an-a-tor-onion
  situation: A route must be relayed through intermediaries so that no single intermediary holds both the origin identity and the final destination, while the traffic still reaches the endpoint.
  original setting: A user's network path reveals both who they are and which destination they contact, because the first hop that sees their address also sees their traffic in full.
  mechanism: Onion routing, where the message is wrapped in one encryption layer per relay, and each relay peels only its own layer and passes the rest to the next hop. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Each intermediary generally knows only the immediately preceding and following nodes, limiting what any single relay can learn about the route."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/public-register__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
