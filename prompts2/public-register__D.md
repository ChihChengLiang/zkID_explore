You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: stalker or scammer compiling public registers
The verifier needs to establish: is a company director or landowner, where combining public registers reveals a home address
Kind of claim (predicate type): cross-source-match
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: public record: the fact is already in a public register or published list
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: justice_security
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-gov-household-register-proxy-copy-discretion
  situation: A government office that holds a record may ask a proxy's requester for a copy of the principal's identity document, and the scope of what it may collect is left to the office's discretion.
  original setting: 內政部函釋：戶政事務所受理委託申請戶籍謄本時，得為蒐集委託人身分證明文件影本，並可斟酌裁量所需附繳證明。
  mechanism: None stated; collection of document copies left to agency discretion under PDPA and administrative procedure rules. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "即得為蒐集、處理申請人之個人資料（例如繳 驗委託人身分證明文件影本）"
- id: tw-telco-online-id-check-fraud-2021
  situation: A provider must verify that a new applicant is the named person, but its check uses identifiers that are easy to copy, so a stolen identity passes and the real person bears the consequences.
  original setting: 詐騙集團以竊取的身分證資料在電信線上平台申辦門號，電信業者僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證，造成上百人受害。
  mechanism: None; online verification only checked ID number and issue date. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證"
- id: an-b-sealed-bid-far
  situation: A party submits a value that must stay hidden from competitors until a fixed moment, while the holder of the submissions must be able to prove later that none were seen early and must handle identifying wrappers without exposing the content.
  original setting: Federal sealed bids must stay unopened and unviewed in a locked or restricted-access box until the scheduled opening, and envelopes may be opened only to identify them by an official designated for that purpose.
  mechanism: Physical and access-control safeguarding of sealed bids with designated-official exception for envelope identification, plus a written record of any mistaken early opening. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "the bids shall not be opened or viewed, and shall remain in a locked bid box, a safe, or in a secured, restricted-access electronic bid box."
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: tw-pdpa-art5-purpose-limit
  situation: A rule requires anyone collecting personal data to stay within the necessary scope of its stated purpose, but it gives no concrete way to show what was necessary, so the collector decides what counts as necessary.
  original setting: 個資法第5條要求蒐集、處理或利用個人資料不得逾越特定目的之必要範圍，並應與蒐集目的具正當合理之關聯。
  mechanism: Legal purpose-limitation and proportionality principle; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料之蒐集、處理或利用，應尊重當事人之權益，依誠實及信用方法為之，不得逾越特定目的之必要範圍，並應與蒐集之目的具有正當合理之關聯。"
- id: an-b-witness-protection
  situation: A protected person must be able to show a new identity without revealing the old one, but the program holder keeps a discretionary exception that lets it disclose the true identity to law enforcement or by court order.
  original setting: The Attorney General may disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of a relocated or protected witness, weighing danger to the person against the public benefit.
  mechanism: Discretionary non-disclosure of identity and location, with a mandatory disclosure exception to State or local law enforcement on request or by court order when the person is under investigation or charged with a serious offense. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of the person relocated or protected"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/public-register__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
