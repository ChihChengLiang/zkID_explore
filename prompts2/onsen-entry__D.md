You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: onsen or public bath with gender-separated areas (google: spa)
The verifier needs to establish: is a woman, or is over a tattoo-policy age, without showing a full ID
Kind of claim (predicate type): membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: commercial convenience: the verifier collects it because it is easy or helps its business (marketing, fraud screening, habit), with no legal duty
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: leisure_events
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: an-b-jury-selection
  situation: Someone must be drawn from a pool and seated for a task without the wider public learning who they are, but the default rule can flip to full publication of the identities of everyone selected, with confidentiality only as a judge-level exception.
  original setting: A federal district plan may make juror names public, but may also let a judge keep those names confidential where the interests of justice require.
  mechanism: Judge-discretionary confidentiality of juror names under a court's jury selection plan; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court"
- id: gdpr-data-minimisation
  situation: A rule obliges anyone requesting information to take only what the purpose needs, but gives no practical way to request less than a whole document.
  original setting: Controllers collect whole documents when a narrower field would serve the purpose.
  mechanism: Legal principle of data minimisation; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed"
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."
- id: an-a-privacy-pass
  situation: A verifier only needs to learn that the holder passed an earlier check, but the proof it receives can be matched to the issuance event and to every other use of the same proof.
  original setting: Servers authorise clients with cookies that record a prior challenge, and the same cookie lets them track one client across sessions.
  mechanism: Clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to a prior authorisation, so the origin cannot link redemption to issuance or to other redemptions. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "the privacy goals of Privacy Pass are oriented around unlinkability based on redemption, issuance, and attestation contexts"
- id: rd-google-wallet-zkp-age-no-linkage
  situation: A gatekeeper needs one yes/no fact about a holder, and the proof it receives must not reveal the underlying birth date or let the issuer or the gatekeeper track the holder.
  original setting: Apps asking for age or identity through Google Wallet's digital ID receive shared data; the vendor says it uses zero-knowledge proofs so a verifier learns only the claim.
  mechanism: Zero-knowledge proof on ISO 18013-7 mdocs for an over-18 statement, device-bound transactions, no server-side storage of credential data. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "ZKP ensures that presentations are not identifiable or trackable by the issuer, the relying party, or Google."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/onsen-entry__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
