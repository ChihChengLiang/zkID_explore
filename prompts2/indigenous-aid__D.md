You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: scholarship or land programme for indigenous people (原住民身分)
The verifier needs to establish: holds recognised indigenous status (ethnicity: special category)
Kind of claim (predicate type): membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: consented for benefit: the person hands it over voluntarily to receive a benefit or service (discount, subsidy, access)
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: education
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-a-chaum-blind
  situation: A signer must certify that a holder has a valid token without seeing the token's content, and must later be unable to link the certified token back to the signing event.
  original setting: A ballot authority must sign a voter's ballot to certify it, but it must not learn how the voter voted, and the counted ballot must still be accepted as valid.
  mechanism: A blind signature, where the message is blinded with a random factor before signing, and the holder unblinds the signature so it verifies against the original message under the signer's public key. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting."
- id: tw-telco-online-id-check-fraud-2021
  situation: A provider must verify that a new applicant is the named person, but its check uses identifiers that are easy to copy, so a stolen identity passes and the real person bears the consequences.
  original setting: 詐騙集團以竊取的身分證資料在電信線上平台申辦門號，電信業者僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證，造成上百人受害。
  mechanism: None; online verification only checked ID number and issue date. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證"
- id: an-b-jury-selection
  situation: Someone must be drawn from a pool and seated for a task without the wider public learning who they are, but the default rule can flip to full publication of the identities of everyone selected, with confidentiality only as a judge-level exception.
  original setting: A federal district plan may make juror names public, but may also let a judge keep those names confidential where the interests of justice require.
  mechanism: Judge-discretionary confidentiality of juror names under a court's jury selection plan; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court"
- id: rd-cnpd-lu-tourist-inspect-not-copy
  situation: A host must confirm a visitor's identity and eligibility, but the usual practice is to keep a copy of the whole identity document; the regulator says looking at it is enough.
  original setting: Tourist accommodation operators in Luxembourg ask to see guests' identity documents and some make copies; the regulator reminds them that inspection is allowed and copying is not.
  mechanism: Visual inspection of the identity document with no copy taken; the statutory duty is met by checking, not retaining. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "they may inspect their customers’ identity documents but must not under any circumstances make a copy of them"
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/indigenous-aid__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
