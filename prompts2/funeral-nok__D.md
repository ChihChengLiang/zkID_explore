You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: funeral home arranging cremation (google: funeral_home)
The verifier needs to establish: is a next of kin of the deceased, in the right order of priority
Kind of claim (predicate type): membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: required by law: a statute or regulator obliges the verifier to collect (and often keep) it (KYC/AML, tenancy, licensing)
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: family_social
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-b-secret-ballot-moad
  situation: A voter must prove eligibility and cast a valid choice while the record of that choice cannot be linked back to them, but the same process must still let officials verify who voted, so the separation depends on procedure rather than on a proof.
  original setting: In the Australian secret ballot, voters keep their identity anonymous from the vote they cast, with separate voting compartments and sealed double envelopes for postal votes.
  mechanism: Separate voting compartments and two-envelope sealing for postal and absentee ballots so identity is not attached to the vote at counting; eligibility is checked separately from the ballot. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "A secret ballot is a voting method where the voter keeps their identity anonymous to provide political privacy."
- id: tw-securities-foreign-agent-id-copy
  situation: A foreign investor must prove that its local agent is a real, identified person, and the agent hands over a full copy of an ID card, with no alternative verification stated.
  original setting: 境外華僑及外國人經國內代理人辦理證券開戶時，代理人須檢附國民身分證或居留證影本。
  mechanism: None stated; full ID copy required with no less-intrusive alternative given. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "國內代理人或代表人之國民身分證、居留證影本或公司登記後之證明文件影本"
- id: rd-cnpd-lu-tourist-inspect-not-copy
  situation: A host must confirm a visitor's identity and eligibility, but the usual practice is to keep a copy of the whole identity document; the regulator says looking at it is enough.
  original setting: Tourist accommodation operators in Luxembourg ask to see guests' identity documents and some make copies; the regulator reminds them that inspection is allowed and copying is not.
  mechanism: Visual inspection of the identity document with no copy taken; the statutory duty is met by checking, not retaining. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "they may inspect their customers’ identity documents but must not under any circumstances make a copy of them"
- id: rd-singpass-myinfo-minimal-request
  situation: A service provider needs a few verified fields for one purpose, but the retrieval interface returns a broad profile and the only limit is a policy rule on the partner.
  original setting: Singpass MyInfo partners retrieve citizen data on consent, and the developer rules tell partners not to over-collect beyond what a single purpose needs.
  mechanism: Consent-gated retrieval of named MyInfo fields, with a rule to request only needed data and purge unsubmitted drafts. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Do not over-collect data, where this is not required for business purposes or legal reasons."
- id: an-b-witness-protection
  situation: A protected person must be able to show a new identity without revealing the old one, but the program holder keeps a discretionary exception that lets it disclose the true identity to law enforcement or by court order.
  original setting: The Attorney General may disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of a relocated or protected witness, weighing danger to the person against the public benefit.
  mechanism: Discretionary non-disclosure of identity and location, with a mandatory disclosure exception to State or local law enforcement on request or by court order when the person is under investigation or charged with a serious offense. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of the person relocated or protected"
- id: rd-eudi-wallet-selective-disclosure-recital
  situation: A verifier needs one attribute from a larger identity record, but the holder cannot share just that attribute from the record.
  original setting: EU law requires the Digital Identity Wallet to let users disclose only some attributes, so relying parties can get what the service needs and no more.
  mechanism: Selective disclosure of attributes from electronic attestations held in the EU Digital Identity Wallet. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The European Digital Identity Wallet should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/funeral-nok__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
