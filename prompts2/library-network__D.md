You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: library network or university partner library
The verifier needs to establish: has no overdue or lost items elsewhere in the network
Kind of claim (predicate type): non-membership
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: consented for benefit: the person hands it over voluntarily to receive a benefit or service (discount, subsidy, access)
The fact originates in: civic_community; it is used in: civic_community
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-gov-household-register-original-only
  situation: A person asking an agency for a record must prove identity; the rule specifies inspecting the original card rather than handing over a copy, and it does not say the agency retains anything.
  original setting: 請領戶籍謄本時，申請人或利害關係人親自申請須繳驗身分證明文件正本，利害關係證明亦須正本。
  mechanism: Original identity document shown for in-person inspection; the checklist states no retention or copy requirement. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "當事人、利害關係人親自申請者，應繳驗身分證明文件正本；利害關係人應併繳驗利害關係證明文件正本。"
- id: tw-telco-online-id-check-fraud-2021
  situation: A provider must verify that a new applicant is the named person, but its check uses identifiers that are easy to copy, so a stolen identity passes and the real person bears the consequences.
  original setting: 詐騙集團以竊取的身分證資料在電信線上平台申辦門號，電信業者僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證，造成上百人受害。
  mechanism: None; online verification only checked ID number and issue date. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "僅審查身分證號與換發日期即通過認證"
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: an-b-secret-ballot-moad
  situation: A voter must prove eligibility and cast a valid choice while the record of that choice cannot be linked back to them, but the same process must still let officials verify who voted, so the separation depends on procedure rather than on a proof.
  original setting: In the Australian secret ballot, voters keep their identity anonymous from the vote they cast, with separate voting compartments and sealed double envelopes for postal votes.
  mechanism: Separate voting compartments and two-envelope sealing for postal and absentee ballots so identity is not attached to the vote at counting; eligibility is checked separately from the ballot. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "A secret ballot is a voting method where the voter keeps their identity anonymous to provide political privacy."
- id: an-b-ala-library-records
  situation: A service provider must keep a record of who used what without that record becoming a readable log of a person's interests, but the duty is a recommended policy that depends on each institution adopting it and on courts or subpoenas being resisted.
  original setting: Libraries should adopt a policy that treats circulation records and other records identifying library users as confidential, and resist legal demands for them absent a proper showing of good cause.
  mechanism: Institutional confidentiality policy plus procedures for handling subpoenas and law-enforcement requests; no technical minimization of records is specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Formally adopt a policy that specifically recognizes its circulation records and other records identifying the names of library users to be confidential."
- id: rd-aepd-hotel-no-id-copy
  situation: A registrant must prove a small set of facts to a host, but the host asks for a full copy of the identity document, which carries many extra fields the rule never needed.
  original setting: Hotels must register guests' identity data under the hospitality registration decree; the regulator says that duty does not authorise photocopying the whole ID document.
  mechanism: Inspect the identity document in person and record only the fields the registration rule requires; no copy retained. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "esto vulneraría el principio de minimización de datos y supondría un tratamiento excesivo"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/library-network__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
