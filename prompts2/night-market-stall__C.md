You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: night-market management committee (OSM: marketplace)
The verifier needs to establish: holds a current food-hygiene and stall permit
Kind of claim (predicate type): freshness
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: required by law: a statute or regulator obliges the verifier to collect (and often keep) it (KYC/AML, tenancy, licensing)
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: commerce
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-b-secret-ballot-moad
  situation: A voter must prove eligibility and cast a valid choice while the record of that choice cannot be linked back to them, but the same process must still let officials verify who voted, so the separation depends on procedure rather than on a proof.
  original setting: In the Australian secret ballot, voters keep their identity anonymous from the vote they cast, with separate voting compartments and sealed double envelopes for postal votes.
  mechanism: Separate voting compartments and two-envelope sealing for postal and absentee ballots so identity is not attached to the vote at counting; eligibility is checked separately from the ballot. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "A secret ballot is a voting method where the voter keeps their identity anonymous to provide political privacy."
- id: an-a-nist-dp
  situation: A releaser must answer queries about a dataset so that an observer learns almost nothing about whether any one individual contributed, and the leak must be expressed as a bound that can be checked.
  original setting: Publishing statistics about a dataset can reveal whether a particular person's record is in it, and the publisher has no quantified measure of how much that leaks.
  mechanism: Differential privacy, a randomised release mechanism with a quantified privacy-loss parameter; NIST notes that the guarantee depends on how the framework is realised in practice and lists privacy hazards that can break it. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "This publication describes differential privacy — a mathematical framework that quantifies privacy loss to entities when their data appears in a dataset."
- id: tw-gov-household-register-proxy-copy-discretion
  situation: A government office that holds a record may ask a proxy's requester for a copy of the principal's identity document, and the scope of what it may collect is left to the office's discretion.
  original setting: 內政部函釋：戶政事務所受理委託申請戶籍謄本時，得為蒐集委託人身分證明文件影本，並可斟酌裁量所需附繳證明。
  mechanism: None stated; collection of document copies left to agency discretion under PDPA and administrative procedure rules. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "即得為蒐集、處理申請人之個人資料（例如繳 驗委託人身分證明文件影本）"
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."
- id: an-b-ala-library-records
  situation: A service provider must keep a record of who used what without that record becoming a readable log of a person's interests, but the duty is a recommended policy that depends on each institution adopting it and on courts or subpoenas being resisted.
  original setting: Libraries should adopt a policy that treats circulation records and other records identifying library users as confidential, and resist legal demands for them absent a proper showing of good cause.
  mechanism: Institutional confidentiality policy plus procedures for handling subpoenas and law-enforcement requests; no technical minimization of records is specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Formally adopt a policy that specifically recognizes its circulation records and other records identifying the names of library users to be confidential."
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/night-market-stall__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
