You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: bank releasing a deceased person's deposits
The verifier needs to establish: is an heir entitled to at least a stated share, without exposing the whole family tree
Kind of claim (predicate type): threshold
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: required by law: a statute or regulator obliges the verifier to collect (and often keep) it (KYC/AML, tenancy, licensing)
The fact originates in: government_admin; it is used in: finance
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-platform-gym-id-card-copies-interp
  situation: A service provider signing up a customer must check identity and payment, but it asks for full front-and-back copies of identity and card documents, and the regulator leaves whether that exceeds the purpose to case-by-case fact-finding.
  original setting: 健身中心於簽立會員契約時要求消費者提供身分證正反面影本及信用卡正反面影本，是否逾越特定目的必要範圍。
  mechanism: None stated; the letter says less-intrusive alternatives must be considered but names none. (outcome: unknown)
  evidence: "健身中心業者於簽立會員契約時，要求消費者提供身分證正反面影本"
- id: an-a-tor-onion
  situation: A route must be relayed through intermediaries so that no single intermediary holds both the origin identity and the final destination, while the traffic still reaches the endpoint.
  original setting: A user's network path reveals both who they are and which destination they contact, because the first hop that sees their address also sees their traffic in full.
  mechanism: Onion routing, where the message is wrapped in one encryption layer per relay, and each relay peels only its own layer and passes the rest to the next hop. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Each intermediary generally knows only the immediately preceding and following nodes, limiting what any single relay can learn about the route."
- id: an-b-jury-selection
  situation: Someone must be drawn from a pool and seated for a task without the wider public learning who they are, but the default rule can flip to full publication of the identities of everyone selected, with confidentiality only as a judge-level exception.
  original setting: A federal district plan may make juror names public, but may also let a judge keep those names confidential where the interests of justice require.
  mechanism: Judge-discretionary confidentiality of juror names under a court's jury selection plan; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court"
- id: an-b-ala-library-records
  situation: A service provider must keep a record of who used what without that record becoming a readable log of a person's interests, but the duty is a recommended policy that depends on each institution adopting it and on courts or subpoenas being resisted.
  original setting: Libraries should adopt a policy that treats circulation records and other records identifying library users as confidential, and resist legal demands for them absent a proper showing of good cause.
  mechanism: Institutional confidentiality policy plus procedures for handling subpoenas and law-enforcement requests; no technical minimization of records is specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Formally adopt a policy that specifically recognizes its circulation records and other records identifying the names of library users to be confidential."
- id: an-b-census-title13
  situation: An agency holding individual responses must release aggregate results, and the legal duty bars any output from which a particular respondent can be singled out, while the holder's staff can still see the raw records.
  original setting: Census data may be used only for statistical purposes, and no publication may allow data furnished by a particular individual or establishment to be identified.
  mechanism: Statutory use limitation and publication prohibition enforced by sworn-oath duties and penalties; statistical disclosure limitation (for example differential privacy in later census products) is a technical layer not specified in the statute. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified"
- id: tw-securities-foreign-agent-id-copy
  situation: A foreign investor must prove that its local agent is a real, identified person, and the agent hands over a full copy of an ID card, with no alternative verification stated.
  original setting: 境外華僑及外國人經國內代理人辦理證券開戶時，代理人須檢附國民身分證或居留證影本。
  mechanism: None stated; full ID copy required with no less-intrusive alternative given. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "國內代理人或代表人之國民身分證、居留證影本或公司登記後之證明文件影本"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/inheritance-bank__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
