You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: local party primary or civic forum vote
The verifier needs to establish: is a registered party member in this district (political opinion: special category)
Kind of claim (predicate type): uniqueness
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: consented for benefit: the person hands it over voluntarily to receive a benefit or service (discount, subsidy, access)
The fact originates in: civic_community; it is used in: civic_community
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: tw-platform-google-id-upload-complaint
  situation: A service needs to confirm a subscriber's payment, but it demands an identity document and address proof, and threatens suspension if the user refuses, without stating the purpose or necessity.
  original setting: 訂閱用戶付款正常卻被要求上傳身分證與含住址帳單，否則帳戶將停權；消基會認為已過度蒐集個資。
  mechanism: None; the complaint notes no stated purpose or less-intrusive alternative was offered. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "若僅涉及訂閱付款驗證，要求提供身分證與住址資料，顯已超出合理必要範圍，恐構成過度蒐集。"
- id: gdpr-data-minimisation
  situation: A rule obliges anyone requesting information to take only what the purpose needs, but gives no practical way to request less than a whole document.
  original setting: Controllers collect whole documents when a narrower field would serve the purpose.
  mechanism: Legal principle of data minimisation; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed"
- id: rd-swiss-eid-necessary-data-only
  situation: A business needs one attribute to proceed, but the credential is issued as a whole, so the holder must rely on the wallet to release only the needed attribute.
  original setting: The Swiss e-ID is described as sharing only the data a transaction needs; the technical overview says selective disclosure and batch issuance enable this.
  mechanism: SD-JWT VC selective disclosure with OpenID4VP presentation and status-list validity check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The Swiss e-ID introduces a new approach to digital identity: only the necessary data is shared."
- id: tw-gov-household-register-proxy-copy-discretion
  situation: A government office that holds a record may ask a proxy's requester for a copy of the principal's identity document, and the scope of what it may collect is left to the office's discretion.
  original setting: 內政部函釋：戶政事務所受理委託申請戶籍謄本時，得為蒐集委託人身分證明文件影本，並可斟酌裁量所需附繳證明。
  mechanism: None stated; collection of document copies left to agency discretion under PDPA and administrative procedure rules. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "即得為蒐集、處理申請人之個人資料（例如繳 驗委託人身分證明文件影本）"
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/party-primary__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
