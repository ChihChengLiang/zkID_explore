You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: disaster-shelter volunteer coordination
The verifier needs to establish: holds a current nursing licence in good standing
Kind of claim (predicate type): freshness
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: safety security: collected to protect people or premises (access control, child safety, fraud/abuse prevention)
The fact originates in: healthcare; it is used in: civic_community
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-b-hipaa-safe-harbor
  situation: A party wants to share a record set that cannot identify any person, but the test is a checklist of removable fields plus a no-actual-knowledge condition, so the holder must still judge whether leftover fields re-identify someone.
  original setting: Health information may be shared for research or trials as de-identified data only after a fixed list of identifiers of the individual and of relatives, employers or household members is removed.
  mechanism: Safe Harbor method removing 18 enumerated identifiers (with ZIP-code truncation rule and age aggregation), or an expert-determination alternative; re-identification codes allowed only if not derived from or disclosed about the individual. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, are removed"
- id: tw-bank-deposit-dual-id-check
  situation: A bank must verify who a person is before opening an account, which means examining identity documents, but the cited rule does not say whether copies are kept or for how long.
  original setting: 金管會函釋：金融機構受理開立存款帳戶，應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分之措施，以防制金融犯罪。
  mechanism: Dual identity-document inspection at account opening; retention and copy handling not specified in the cited text. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分"
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."
- id: tw-gov-household-register-proxy-copy-discretion
  situation: A government office that holds a record may ask a proxy's requester for a copy of the principal's identity document, and the scope of what it may collect is left to the office's discretion.
  original setting: 內政部函釋：戶政事務所受理委託申請戶籍謄本時，得為蒐集委託人身分證明文件影本，並可斟酌裁量所需附繳證明。
  mechanism: None stated; collection of document copies left to agency discretion under PDPA and administrative procedure rules. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "即得為蒐集、處理申請人之個人資料（例如繳 驗委託人身分證明文件影本）"
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: an-b-jury-selection
  situation: Someone must be drawn from a pool and seated for a task without the wider public learning who they are, but the default rule can flip to full publication of the identities of everyone selected, with confidentiality only as a judge-level exception.
  original setting: A federal district plan may make juror names public, but may also let a judge keep those names confidential where the interests of justice require.
  mechanism: Judge-discretionary confidentiality of juror names under a court's jury selection plan; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/disaster-nurse__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
