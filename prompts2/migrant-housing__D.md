You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: dormitory or landlord renting to migrant workers (外籍移工)
The verifier needs to establish: is legally working for a sponsoring employer right now
Kind of claim (predicate type): freshness
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: consented for benefit: the person hands it over voluntarily to receive a benefit or service (discount, subsidy, access)
The fact originates in: employment; it is used in: housing
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-b-va-id-scanning
  situation: A venue must confirm that a person is over a threshold age from an identity document, but scanning captures the whole card, so the rule caps what is kept to a few fields and bans secondary use, while the holder still sees everything on the card at the moment of the scan.
  original setting: A merchant may scan the machine-readable zone of a driver's license for an age check, but the scan data it may collect and keep is limited to name, address, date of birth and license number, and may not be disseminated for marketing.
  mechanism: Statutory field-limit and retention ban on scan data, with a prohibition on sale or marketing dissemination; no proof-of-age mechanism that avoids reading the document. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Information collected by scanning an individual's driver's license or other document pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the individual's name, address, and date of birth and the number of the driver's license or other document;"
- id: an-b-sealed-bid-far
  situation: A party submits a value that must stay hidden from competitors until a fixed moment, while the holder of the submissions must be able to prove later that none were seen early and must handle identifying wrappers without exposing the content.
  original setting: Federal sealed bids must stay unopened and unviewed in a locked or restricted-access box until the scheduled opening, and envelopes may be opened only to identify them by an official designated for that purpose.
  mechanism: Physical and access-control safeguarding of sealed bids with designated-official exception for envelope identification, plus a written record of any mistaken early opening. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "the bids shall not be opened or viewed, and shall remain in a locked bid box, a safe, or in a secured, restricted-access electronic bid box."
- id: gdpr-data-minimisation
  situation: A rule obliges anyone requesting information to take only what the purpose needs, but gives no practical way to request less than a whole document.
  original setting: Controllers collect whole documents when a narrower field would serve the purpose.
  mechanism: Legal principle of data minimisation; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed"
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: tw-platform-google-id-upload-complaint
  situation: A service needs to confirm a subscriber's payment, but it demands an identity document and address proof, and threatens suspension if the user refuses, without stating the purpose or necessity.
  original setting: 訂閱用戶付款正常卻被要求上傳身分證與含住址帳單，否則帳戶將停權；消基會認為已過度蒐集個資。
  mechanism: None; the complaint notes no stated purpose or less-intrusive alternative was offered. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "若僅涉及訂閱付款驗證，要求提供身分證與住址資料，顯已超出合理必要範圍，恐構成過度蒐集。"
- id: tw-bank-deposit-dual-id-check
  situation: A bank must verify who a person is before opening an account, which means examining identity documents, but the cited rule does not say whether copies are kept or for how long.
  original setting: 金管會函釋：金融機構受理開立存款帳戶，應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分之措施，以防制金融犯罪。
  mechanism: Dual identity-document inspection at account opening; retention and copy handling not specified in the cited text. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "應實施雙重身分證明文件查核及確認客戶身分"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/migrant-housing__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
