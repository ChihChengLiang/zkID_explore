You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: school gate, delegated pickup (google: school)
The verifier needs to establish: is authorised by the guardian to collect this child today
Kind of claim (predicate type): time-bounded
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: safety security: collected to protect people or premises (access control, child safety, fraud/abuse prevention)
The fact originates in: family_social; it is used in: education
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-b-ala-library-records
  situation: A service provider must keep a record of who used what without that record becoming a readable log of a person's interests, but the duty is a recommended policy that depends on each institution adopting it and on courts or subpoenas being resisted.
  original setting: Libraries should adopt a policy that treats circulation records and other records identifying library users as confidential, and resist legal demands for them absent a proper showing of good cause.
  mechanism: Institutional confidentiality policy plus procedures for handling subpoenas and law-enforcement requests; no technical minimization of records is specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Formally adopt a policy that specifically recognizes its circulation records and other records identifying the names of library users to be confidential."
- id: rd-aepd-hotel-no-id-copy
  situation: A registrant must prove a small set of facts to a host, but the host asks for a full copy of the identity document, which carries many extra fields the rule never needed.
  original setting: Hotels must register guests' identity data under the hospitality registration decree; the regulator says that duty does not authorise photocopying the whole ID document.
  mechanism: Inspect the identity document in person and record only the fields the registration rule requires; no copy retained. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "esto vulneraría el principio de minimización de datos y supondría un tratamiento excesivo"
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."
- id: tw-securities-foreign-agent-id-copy
  situation: A foreign investor must prove that its local agent is a real, identified person, and the agent hands over a full copy of an ID card, with no alternative verification stated.
  original setting: 境外華僑及外國人經國內代理人辦理證券開戶時，代理人須檢附國民身分證或居留證影本。
  mechanism: None stated; full ID copy required with no less-intrusive alternative given. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "國內代理人或代表人之國民身分證、居留證影本或公司登記後之證明文件影本"
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: an-b-census-title13
  situation: An agency holding individual responses must release aggregate results, and the legal duty bars any output from which a particular respondent can be singled out, while the holder's staff can still see the raw records.
  original setting: Census data may be used only for statistical purposes, and no publication may allow data furnished by a particular individual or establishment to be identified.
  mechanism: Statutory use limitation and publication prohibition enforced by sworn-oath duties and penalties; statistical disclosure limitation (for example differential privacy in later census products) is a technical layer not specified in the statute. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/school-pickup__C.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
