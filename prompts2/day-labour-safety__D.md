You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan. Work alone; read no repository file other than the ones named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Setting where the verifier works: construction hiring hall or contractor
The verifier needs to establish: has a valid safety-training certificate for scaffolding or high work
Kind of claim (predicate type): time-bounded
Today the verifier collects the information under this condition: required by law: a statute or regulator obliges the verifier to collect (and often keep) it (KYC/AML, tenancy, licensing)
The fact originates in: education; it is used in: employment
Who could sign the claim is open: you name the issuer (a government body, company, school, hospital, community body, platform or even a peer).

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings). You MUST use at least two of these six items as structural inspiration:
- id: an-a-oauth-scopes
  situation: A holder asks a verifier for a credential covering more attributes than the single fact the relying party needs, and the issuer has no obligation to honour a narrower request.
  original setting: A client asks for broad access scopes to a resource server when it needs only one narrow permission, and the user approves the broader grant.
  mechanism: The client states a scope parameter in the request, and the authorization server returns the granted scope in the token response; the server may grant less than requested. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The authorization server MAY fully or partially ignore the scope requested by the client, based on the authorization server policy or the resource owner's instructions."
- id: an-b-census-title13
  situation: An agency holding individual responses must release aggregate results, and the legal duty bars any output from which a particular respondent can be singled out, while the holder's staff can still see the raw records.
  original setting: Census data may be used only for statistical purposes, and no publication may allow data furnished by a particular individual or establishment to be identified.
  mechanism: Statutory use limitation and publication prohibition enforced by sworn-oath duties and penalties; statistical disclosure limitation (for example differential privacy in later census products) is a technical layer not specified in the statute. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified"
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."
- id: rd-aepd-hotel-no-id-copy
  situation: A registrant must prove a small set of facts to a host, but the host asks for a full copy of the identity document, which carries many extra fields the rule never needed.
  original setting: Hotels must register guests' identity data under the hospitality registration decree; the regulator says that duty does not authorise photocopying the whole ID document.
  mechanism: Inspect the identity document in person and record only the fields the registration rule requires; no copy retained. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "esto vulneraría el principio de minimización de datos y supondría un tratamiento excesivo"
- id: tw-telco-sim-live-photo-retention
  situation: A provider must confirm a new subscriber's identity before activating a service; the rule requires capturing a live photo of the person at point of sale, with no stated limit on retention.
  original setting: 依NCC指引，初次申辦行動門號者必須即時拍照留存，不願配合者門市應拒絕辦理。
  mechanism: None minimal; in-store photo capture required, no retention limit or less-intrusive alternative stated. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "要求初次申辦行動通信門號者必須即時拍照留存"
- id: an-b-hipaa-safe-harbor
  situation: A party wants to share a record set that cannot identify any person, but the test is a checklist of removable fields plus a no-actual-knowledge condition, so the holder must still judge whether leftover fields re-identify someone.
  original setting: Health information may be shared for research or trials as de-identified data only after a fixed list of identifiers of the individual and of relatives, employers or household members is removed.
  mechanism: Safe Harbor method removing 18 enumerated identifiers (with ZIP-code truncation rule and age aggregation), or an expert-determination alternative; re-identification codes allowed only if not derived from or disclosed about the individual. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, are removed"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan, each with a different verifier party or situation, where today the verifier collects far more than it needs and the claim above would be enough. Do not repeat the cell text as the idea; make each moment specific. Be honest in why_zk if law or practice makes it weak.

For each idea, `inspired_by` must list the seeds you actually used. Each `borrowed_aspect` must be one sentence of the form "In <seed>, <X> does <Y>; here, <Z> plays that role", i.e. a mapping, not a vague echo. Every one of the six seeds does not have to be used, but each idea must cite at least one, and the three ideas together at least two different seeds.

Write ONLY a JSON list of 3 objects to ideas2/day-labour-safety__D.json (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (a list of {"seed_id": ..., "borrowed_aspect": ...}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
