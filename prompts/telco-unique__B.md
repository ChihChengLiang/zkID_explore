You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan (digital wallet, government and private issuers). Work alone; do not read any file in this repository other than what is named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Attribute source (who could sign the claim): telco
Predicate type: uniqueness
Situation: A telco can sign that a person is one real subscriber; a verifier wants one account per person without learning which person.

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings; use any that help, ignore any that don't):
- id: tw-gov-uid-duplicate-minimal-disclosure
  situation: A party asks a registry for identity-number information to settle a dispute; the registry could disclose the full reassigned value, but a narrower answer, whether a duplicate exists, is enough to settle it.
  original setting: 金融機構因國民身分證統一編號重複申請網路銀行而生爭議，欲索取重配後統號；內政部函釋戶政僅可告知有無重複。
  mechanism: Registry reports only whether the number is duplicated, not the reassigned number; the bank marks its own internal record instead. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "戶政事務所得僅告知國民身分證統一編號有無重複，而不提供 其變更之統號"
- id: an-a-chaum-blind
  situation: A signer must certify that a holder has a valid token without seeing the token's content, and must later be unable to link the certified token back to the signing event.
  original setting: A ballot authority must sign a voter's ballot to certify it, but it must not learn how the voter voted, and the counted ballot must still be accepted as valid.
  mechanism: A blind signature, where the message is blinded with a random factor before signing, and the holder unblinds the signature so it verifies against the original message under the signer's public key. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting."
- id: an-a-privacy-pass
  situation: A verifier only needs to learn that the holder passed an earlier check, but the proof it receives can be matched to the issuance event and to every other use of the same proof.
  original setting: Servers authorise clients with cookies that record a prior challenge, and the same cookie lets them track one client across sessions.
  mechanism: Clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to a prior authorisation, so the origin cannot link redemption to issuance or to other redemptions. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "the privacy goals of Privacy Pass are oriented around unlinkability based on redemption, issuance, and attestation contexts"
- id: an-b-secret-ballot-moad
  situation: A voter must prove eligibility and cast a valid choice while the record of that choice cannot be linked back to them, but the same process must still let officials verify who voted, so the separation depends on procedure rather than on a proof.
  original setting: In the Australian secret ballot, voters keep their identity anonymous from the vote they cast, with separate voting compartments and sealed double envelopes for postal votes.
  mechanism: Separate voting compartments and two-envelope sealing for postal and absentee ballots so identity is not attached to the vote at counting; eligibility is checked separately from the ballot. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "A secret ballot is a voting method where the voter keeps their identity anonymous to provide political privacy."
- id: privacy-pass-unlinkable-proof
  situation: A gatekeeper only needs to know that the visitor already passed some check, but the proof it accepts doubles as a persistent identifier.
  original setting: Servers authorise clients with cookies, which let them track the same client across sessions.
  mechanism: Blind-signed tokens that attest prior authorisation and cannot be linked to the issuance interaction. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "Clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to this information."
- id: tw-telco-sim-live-photo-retention
  situation: A provider must confirm a new subscriber's identity before activating a service; the rule requires capturing a live photo of the person at point of sale, with no stated limit on retention.
  original setting: 依NCC指引，初次申辦行動門號者必須即時拍照留存，不願配合者門市應拒絕辦理。
  mechanism: None minimal; in-store photo capture required, no retention limit or less-intrusive alternative stated. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "要求初次申辦行動通信門號者必須即時拍照留存"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan where a verifier today collects far more than it needs, and where a telco-signed uniqueness proof would be enough. Prefer moments that are specific and not the first thing anyone would think of (avoid generic age checks, loan income checks, and diploma verification unless you can make them genuinely specific). Be honest: if a moment is weak because of law or practice, still say so in why_zk rather than hiding it.

For each idea fill inspired_by with the seed ids that actually shaped it and, for each, one sentence naming exactly what you borrowed. Use an empty list only if you truly used none.

Write the three ideas as a YAML list to ideas/telco-unique__B.yaml (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys per item: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (list of {seed_id, borrowed_aspect}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
