You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan (digital wallet, government and private issuers). Work alone; do not read any file in this repository other than what is named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Attribute source (who could sign the claim): telco
Predicate type: uniqueness
Situation: A telco can sign that a person is one real subscriber; a verifier wants one account per person without learning which person.

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings; use any that help, ignore any that don't):
- id: an-b-attorney-client
  situation: A party must consult an advisor about a sensitive matter without the advisor, or anyone else, learning or revealing more than the matter requires, but the protection breaks as soon as an outsider is in the room unless the outsider is essential to the relationship.
  original setting: Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client about seeking legal advice, but the confidentiality is compromised if a third party is present.
  mechanism: Evidentiary privilege over communications, lost by third-party presence except essential agents such as interpreters; no technical mechanism. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client that relate to the client's seeking of legal advice or services."
- id: rd-apple-wallet-age-request-categories
  situation: A verifier wants a single over-threshold fact, but the request category bundles the issuing authority and a face photo with it, so the verifier can receive more than the age claim.
  original setting: Apple's Verify with Wallet API lists the data an app can request for age checks, and the age category also includes the issuing authority and the ID photo.
  mechanism: Age Over N Flag as a separate requestable value under an entitlement-gated API; no shared name or address. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Age verification data: Age Over N Flag Age in Years Issuing Authority ID Photo"
- id: an-b-census-title13
  situation: An agency holding individual responses must release aggregate results, and the legal duty bars any output from which a particular respondent can be singled out, while the holder's staff can still see the raw records.
  original setting: Census data may be used only for statistical purposes, and no publication may allow data furnished by a particular individual or establishment to be identified.
  mechanism: Statutory use limitation and publication prohibition enforced by sworn-oath duties and penalties; statistical disclosure limitation (for example differential privacy in later census products) is a technical layer not specified in the statute. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified"
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."
- id: an-a-tor-onion
  situation: A route must be relayed through intermediaries so that no single intermediary holds both the origin identity and the final destination, while the traffic still reaches the endpoint.
  original setting: A user's network path reveals both who they are and which destination they contact, because the first hop that sees their address also sees their traffic in full.
  mechanism: Onion routing, where the message is wrapped in one encryption layer per relay, and each relay peels only its own layer and passes the rest to the next hop. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Each intermediary generally knows only the immediately preceding and following nodes, limiting what any single relay can learn about the route."
- id: an-b-jury-selection
  situation: Someone must be drawn from a pool and seated for a task without the wider public learning who they are, but the default rule can flip to full publication of the identities of everyone selected, with confidentiality only as a judge-level exception.
  original setting: A federal district plan may make juror names public, but may also let a judge keep those names confidential where the interests of justice require.
  mechanism: Judge-discretionary confidentiality of juror names under a court's jury selection plan; no technical mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan where a verifier today collects far more than it needs, and where a telco-signed uniqueness proof would be enough. Prefer moments that are specific and not the first thing anyone would think of (avoid generic age checks, loan income checks, and diploma verification unless you can make them genuinely specific). Be honest: if a moment is weak because of law or practice, still say so in why_zk rather than hiding it.

For each idea fill inspired_by with the seed ids that actually shaped it and, for each, one sentence naming exactly what you borrowed. Use an empty list only if you truly used none.

Write the three ideas as a YAML list to ideas/telco-unique__D.yaml (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys per item: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (list of {seed_id, borrowed_aspect}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
