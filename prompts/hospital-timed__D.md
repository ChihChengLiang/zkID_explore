You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan (digital wallet, government and private issuers). Work alone; do not read any file in this repository other than what is named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Attribute source (who could sign the claim): hospital
Predicate type: time-bounded
Situation: A hospital can sign a status that is only meaningful within a time window; a verifier needs it valid for that window without learning the clinical detail.

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings; use any that help, ignore any that don't):
- id: rd-google-wallet-zkp-age-no-linkage
  situation: A gatekeeper needs one yes/no fact about a holder, and the proof it receives must not reveal the underlying birth date or let the issuer or the gatekeeper track the holder.
  original setting: Apps asking for age or identity through Google Wallet's digital ID receive shared data; the vendor says it uses zero-knowledge proofs so a verifier learns only the claim.
  mechanism: Zero-knowledge proof on ISO 18013-7 mdocs for an over-18 statement, device-bound transactions, no server-side storage of credential data. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "ZKP ensures that presentations are not identifiable or trackable by the issuer, the relying party, or Google."
- id: an-b-ala-library-records
  situation: A service provider must keep a record of who used what without that record becoming a readable log of a person's interests, but the duty is a recommended policy that depends on each institution adopting it and on courts or subpoenas being resisted.
  original setting: Libraries should adopt a policy that treats circulation records and other records identifying library users as confidential, and resist legal demands for them absent a proper showing of good cause.
  mechanism: Institutional confidentiality policy plus procedures for handling subpoenas and law-enforcement requests; no technical minimization of records is specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Formally adopt a policy that specifically recognizes its circulation records and other records identifying the names of library users to be confidential."
- id: an-b-va-id-scanning
  situation: A venue must confirm that a person is over a threshold age from an identity document, but scanning captures the whole card, so the rule caps what is kept to a few fields and bans secondary use, while the holder still sees everything on the card at the moment of the scan.
  original setting: A merchant may scan the machine-readable zone of a driver's license for an age check, but the scan data it may collect and keep is limited to name, address, date of birth and license number, and may not be disseminated for marketing.
  mechanism: Statutory field-limit and retention ban on scan data, with a prohibition on sale or marketing dissemination; no proof-of-age mechanism that avoids reading the document. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "Information collected by scanning an individual's driver's license or other document pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the individual's name, address, and date of birth and the number of the driver's license or other document;"
- id: rd-cnpd-lu-tourist-inspect-not-copy
  situation: A host must confirm a visitor's identity and eligibility, but the usual practice is to keep a copy of the whole identity document; the regulator says looking at it is enough.
  original setting: Tourist accommodation operators in Luxembourg ask to see guests' identity documents and some make copies; the regulator reminds them that inspection is allowed and copying is not.
  mechanism: Visual inspection of the identity document with no copy taken; the statutory duty is met by checking, not retaining. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "they may inspect their customers’ identity documents but must not under any circumstances make a copy of them"
- id: privacy-pass-unlinkable-proof
  situation: A gatekeeper only needs to know that the visitor already passed some check, but the proof it accepts doubles as a persistent identifier.
  original setting: Servers authorise clients with cookies, which let them track the same client across sessions.
  mechanism: Blind-signed tokens that attest prior authorisation and cannot be linked to the issuance interaction. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "Clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to this information."
- id: an-a-chaum-blind
  situation: A signer must certify that a holder has a valid token without seeing the token's content, and must later be unable to link the certified token back to the signing event.
  original setting: A ballot authority must sign a voter's ballot to certify it, but it must not learn how the voter voted, and the counted ballot must still be accepted as valid.
  mechanism: A blind signature, where the message is blinded with a random factor before signing, and the holder unblinds the signature so it verifies against the original message under the signer's public key. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting."

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan where a verifier today collects far more than it needs, and where a hospital-signed time-bounded proof would be enough. Prefer moments that are specific and not the first thing anyone would think of (avoid generic age checks, loan income checks, and diploma verification unless you can make them genuinely specific). Be honest: if a moment is weak because of law or practice, still say so in why_zk rather than hiding it.

For each idea fill inspired_by with the seed ids that actually shaped it and, for each, one sentence naming exactly what you borrowed. Use an empty list only if you truly used none.

Write the three ideas as a YAML list to ideas/hospital-timed__D.yaml (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys per item: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (list of {seed_id, borrowed_aspect}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
