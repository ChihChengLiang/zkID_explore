You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan (digital wallet, government and private issuers). Work alone; do not read any file in this repository other than what is named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Attribute source (who could sign the claim): bank
Predicate type: aggregate
Situation: A bank can sign a statistic computed over many of a person's transactions or accounts; a verifier wants only the aggregate, not the underlying records.

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings; use any that help, ignore any that don't):
- id: an-a-nist-dp
  situation: A releaser must answer queries about a dataset so that an observer learns almost nothing about whether any one individual contributed, and the leak must be expressed as a bound that can be checked.
  original setting: Publishing statistics about a dataset can reveal whether a particular person's record is in it, and the publisher has no quantified measure of how much that leaks.
  mechanism: Differential privacy, a randomised release mechanism with a quantified privacy-loss parameter; NIST notes that the guarantee depends on how the framework is realised in practice and lists privacy hazards that can break it. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "This publication describes differential privacy — a mathematical framework that quantifies privacy loss to entities when their data appears in a dataset."
- id: an-b-census-title13
  situation: An agency holding individual responses must release aggregate results, and the legal duty bars any output from which a particular respondent can be singled out, while the holder's staff can still see the raw records.
  original setting: Census data may be used only for statistical purposes, and no publication may allow data furnished by a particular individual or establishment to be identified.
  mechanism: Statutory use limitation and publication prohibition enforced by sworn-oath duties and penalties; statistical disclosure limitation (for example differential privacy in later census products) is a technical layer not specified in the statute. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified"
- id: rd-eudi-wallet-selective-disclosure-recital
  situation: A verifier needs one attribute from a larger identity record, but the holder cannot share just that attribute from the record.
  original setting: EU law requires the Digital Identity Wallet to let users disclose only some attributes, so relying parties can get what the service needs and no more.
  mechanism: Selective disclosure of attributes from electronic attestations held in the EU Digital Identity Wallet. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The European Digital Identity Wallet should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties."
- id: an-a-oauth-scopes
  situation: A holder asks a verifier for a credential covering more attributes than the single fact the relying party needs, and the issuer has no obligation to honour a narrower request.
  original setting: A client asks for broad access scopes to a resource server when it needs only one narrow permission, and the user approves the broader grant.
  mechanism: The client states a scope parameter in the request, and the authorization server returns the granted scope in the token response; the server may grant less than requested. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "The authorization server MAY fully or partially ignore the scope requested by the client, based on the authorization server policy or the resource owner's instructions."
- id: an-b-hipaa-min-necessary
  situation: A holder of sensitive records must release only the subset that serves a stated purpose, but the rule leaves it to the holder to judge what is minimal and gives no mechanism that proves the released subset was minimal.
  original setting: Covered entities and business associates must limit protected health information to what a given use, disclosure or request actually needs.
  mechanism: Purpose-based minimum-necessary rule with reasonable-efforts standard, role-based access and reasonable reliance on requester representations (45 CFR 164.514(d)); no cryptographic or proof-based check. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "must make reasonable efforts to limit protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request."
- id: an-b-hipaa-safe-harbor
  situation: A party wants to share a record set that cannot identify any person, but the test is a checklist of removable fields plus a no-actual-knowledge condition, so the holder must still judge whether leftover fields re-identify someone.
  original setting: Health information may be shared for research or trials as de-identified data only after a fixed list of identifiers of the individual and of relatives, employers or household members is removed.
  mechanism: Safe Harbor method removing 18 enumerated identifiers (with ZIP-code truncation rule and age aggregation), or an expert-determination alternative; re-identification codes allowed only if not derived from or disclosed about the individual. (outcome: works)
  evidence: "The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, are removed"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan where a verifier today collects far more than it needs, and where a bank-signed aggregate proof would be enough. Prefer moments that are specific and not the first thing anyone would think of (avoid generic age checks, loan income checks, and diploma verification unless you can make them genuinely specific). Be honest: if a moment is weak because of law or practice, still say so in why_zk rather than hiding it.

For each idea fill inspired_by with the seed ids that actually shaped it and, for each, one sentence naming exactly what you borrowed. Use an empty list only if you truly used none.

Write the three ideas as a YAML list to ideas/bank-aggregate__B.yaml (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys per item: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (list of {seed_id, borrowed_aspect}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
