You are helping find non-obvious uses of zero-knowledge / selective-disclosure credentials in Taiwan (digital wallet, government and private issuers). Work alone; do not read any file in this repository other than what is named here, and do not look at other agents' output.

TASK CELL
Attribute source (who could sign the claim): bank
Predicate type: aggregate
Situation: A bank can sign a statistic computed over many of a person's transactions or accounts; a verifier wants only the aggregate, not the underlying records.

INSPIRATION MATERIAL (real excerpts from other settings; use any that help, ignore any that don't):
- id: an-a-samesite-cookies
  situation: A stored credential should be presented only to the party that issued it in the current context, but the browser sends it on any request the context triggers, so an unrelated observer can match the holder across contexts.
  original setting: A cookie is attached to requests made from third-party sites embedded in a page, which lets those third parties recognise the same browser across unrelated websites.
  mechanism: The SameSite cookie attribute, which limits the cookie to same-site requests (Strict, Lax, or None); the IETF draft describes it as a per-cookie setting, and cross-site behaviour depends on the chosen value. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent along with "same-site" requests."
- id: tw-pdpa-art11-3-deletion-exception
  situation: A party that has collected a person's data must delete it once the reason for holding it ends, but an open-ended exception lets it keep the data whenever it says it still needs it for its own duties.
  original setting: 個資法第11條第3項：特定目的消失或期限屆滿時應刪除，但因執行職務或業務所必須或經書面同意者不在此限。
  mechanism: Statutory deletion-on-purpose-lapse duty with exceptions for lawful duties or written consent; no technical erasure mechanism specified. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "個人資料蒐集之特定目的消失或期限屆滿時，應主動或依當事人之請求，刪除、停止處理或利用該個人資料。但因執行職務或業務所必須或經當事人書面同意者，不在此限。"
- id: tw-securities-foreign-agent-id-copy
  situation: A foreign investor must prove that its local agent is a real, identified person, and the agent hands over a full copy of an ID card, with no alternative verification stated.
  original setting: 境外華僑及外國人經國內代理人辦理證券開戶時，代理人須檢附國民身分證或居留證影本。
  mechanism: None stated; full ID copy required with no less-intrusive alternative given. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "國內代理人或代表人之國民身分證、居留證影本或公司登記後之證明文件影本"
- id: an-b-witness-protection
  situation: A protected person must be able to show a new identity without revealing the old one, but the program holder keeps a discretionary exception that lets it disclose the true identity to law enforcement or by court order.
  original setting: The Attorney General may disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of a relocated or protected witness, weighing danger to the person against the public benefit.
  mechanism: Discretionary non-disclosure of identity and location, with a mandatory disclosure exception to State or local law enforcement on request or by court order when the person is under investigation or charged with a serious offense. (outcome: partial)
  evidence: "disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of the person relocated or protected"
- id: tw-platform-gym-id-card-copies-interp
  situation: A service provider signing up a customer must check identity and payment, but it asks for full front-and-back copies of identity and card documents, and the regulator leaves whether that exceeds the purpose to case-by-case fact-finding.
  original setting: 健身中心於簽立會員契約時要求消費者提供身分證正反面影本及信用卡正反面影本，是否逾越特定目的必要範圍。
  mechanism: None stated; the letter says less-intrusive alternatives must be considered but names none. (outcome: unknown)
  evidence: "健身中心業者於簽立會員契約時，要求消費者提供身分證正反面影本"
- id: tw-platform-google-id-upload-complaint
  situation: A service needs to confirm a subscriber's payment, but it demands an identity document and address proof, and threatens suspension if the user refuses, without stating the purpose or necessity.
  original setting: 訂閱用戶付款正常卻被要求上傳身分證與含住址帳單，否則帳戶將停權；消基會認為已過度蒐集個資。
  mechanism: None; the complaint notes no stated purpose or less-intrusive alternative was offered. (outcome: fails)
  evidence: "若僅涉及訂閱付款驗證，要求提供身分證與住址資料，顯已超出合理必要範圍，恐構成過度蒐集。"

Propose exactly 3 distinct use cases for this cell: concrete everyday moments in Taiwan where a verifier today collects far more than it needs, and where a bank-signed aggregate proof would be enough. Prefer moments that are specific and not the first thing anyone would think of (avoid generic age checks, loan income checks, and diploma verification unless you can make them genuinely specific). Be honest: if a moment is weak because of law or practice, still say so in why_zk rather than hiding it.

For each idea fill inspired_by with the seed ids that actually shaped it and, for each, one sentence naming exactly what you borrowed. Use an empty list only if you truly used none.

Write the three ideas as a YAML list to ideas/bank-aggregate__C.yaml (relative to /Users/liangcc/projects/repos/zkID_explore) with exactly these keys per item: title, moment, verifier, predicate, disclosed_today, issuer, why_zk, inspired_by (list of {seed_id, borrowed_aspect}). Use only the Write tool for that one file. Reply with the single word DONE.
